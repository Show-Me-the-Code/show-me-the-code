There are few opportunities for me to physically go out of my city for sightseeing, and even fewer to take part in a tourist group. Such an occasion came when I was invited to a day trip to Wujiaqu, or Five Family Creek, a new farm-turned city 32 km away from Urumqi to which I¡¯d never been before. Without the least hesitation I accepted the invitation.

It was an outing organized by the local disabled persons¡¯ federation. A 30-strong party of ¡°special citizens¡± and their caretakers, it was a ¡°special group¡± consisting of people with cerebral palsy, polio, and permanent spinal cord injuries. A few sat in wheelchairs, some leaned on crutches, and still some limped around with their heads and hands turning and wringing at odd angles. They could create an attraction unique in its own! But each and every one of them wore a happy face and talked animatedly with one another as I joined the lot on April 30, 2009.
